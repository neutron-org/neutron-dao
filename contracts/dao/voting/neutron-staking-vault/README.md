### Neutron Voting Vault

This vault will allow its users to bond NTRN tokens without locking them (i.e., you can bond and unbond tokens in this vault without unbonding period). Just as with normal DAO DAO voting modules, for each specific proposal, you can only use the voting power that was available to you at the time of proposal submission. No additional restrictions are imposed on the vault funds.
